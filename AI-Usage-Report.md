# AI Usage Report

## AI Usage Report: Building the ADmyBRAND AI Suite Landing Page

Throughout the development of this project, AI played a significant role in accelerating and improving the workflow. We used advanced AI models (via tools like Perplexity AI, ChatGPT, and Cursor IDE) to generate boilerplate React and Next.js code, convert legacy CSS to Tailwind CSS utilities, and produce animation code snippets (GSAP and Framer Motion) that would have been time-consuming to hand-write.  
We used Cursor IDE for debugging and resolving errors in the project.

## Key benefits included:

### Tailwind Migration

Large blocks of global CSS were translated into semantic, reusable Tailwind utility classes, ensuring design consistency and responsive best practices without manual lookup.

### Feature Automation

FAQ accordions, carousels, modals, and validation logic were generated from simple specifications, reducing implementation time and human error.

### Docs & Summaries

AI generated much of this documentation, including the feature list, setup steps, and this usage report.

By leveraging AI tools throughout UI prototyping, animation, and documentation, our productivity was significantly boosted, letting us focus on branding and polish while ensuring code quality and project delivery speed. In summary, AI acted not as a replacement but as an intelligent assistantâ€”multiplying our capacity to iterate, implement, and ship high-quality modern web interfaces.
